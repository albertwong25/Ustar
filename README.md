Final Year Project - Augmented Reality HKUST Navigation App on Android

Although navigation application offer the way how we can get to the destination, most of them do not make distinct notices to the path or the surrounding buildings. Moreover, it is not clear at all since they just show the two-dimensional floor plan. This paper describes a new augmented reality (AR) application called, “Ustar”, that is designed to provide full utilization of navigating inside the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) whole academic building. Using the previous “Ustar” as the background for further develop our application, our goal is to develop a practical AR application that helps users navigate through the indoor spaces of HKUST campus. Not only navigate on the first floor, but also can apply on the other floors inside the campus. After initial testing, we observed that our application lack of informative feature to users. Therefore, we included the course information of all classrooms and Lecture Theater, which the users can know the usage of the rooms to find the vacant rooms. The system development was done by using the user self-defined location, optical-character reader (OCR) and pedometer to support the location-based AR technology for indoor localization, tracking and navigation.
